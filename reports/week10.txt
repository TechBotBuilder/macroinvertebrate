Week 10 Plan:
This begins the convolutional neural network stage. There is code in the 'conv.py' file that seems to be working already, which I based on the "VGG-like convnet" example at https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/#examples. This week I will also write a gridsearch program for the convnet and train a model to ensure the code is correct.

Week 10 Report:
Instead of gridsearch, I spent this week focusing on trying to reduce overfitting in the model. I trained one convolutional network with 50% dropout on its two pooling layers and the dense layer before the classification layer, which achieved 95.2% training data accuracy, but only 23.0% for validation and 28.3% for test data. This demonstrated a serious overfitting problem. In attempting to reduce the overfitting, I worked with another model with activity regularization in the convolution and dense hidden layers, which after some training still shows overfitting (15.9% validation vs 23.6% training accuracy). I will train this model further to see the full extent to which regularization might help. After investigating how to reduce overfitting further, I will do a gridsearch and train a single final model in the coming week.
