Week 9 Plan:
Use the RBM library located last week to train some restricted boltzmann machiens. It is unlikely I will have time to run as many gridsearch options as in the past few weeks; however, there are fewer parameters to vary (the main component is hidden size).
Reading recent discussions online has hinted that RBMs are a technique of the past, used to initialize weight matrices before there were optimizers and random initialization procedures capable of training deep nets without help. I guess we will see the results soon enough.
